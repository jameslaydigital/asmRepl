# asmRepl
An interpreted assembly.

Try running it:

    ./vm.py < new.asm
    ./asmRepl.py < example.asm
    ./asmRepl.py ### interactive session, type exit to leave
    
Currently, the runtimes are built on python, but they could easily be converted to a language like C.
Really, a simple project indeed.
